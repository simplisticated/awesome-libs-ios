## FAQ 🙄

### What's the origin of the name Awesome Libs?

Well, there are two main reasons why we did that:

1. There are many collections of popular open source libraries on GitHub. Usually these collections include the word `awesome` in their name. Examples: [awesome-ios](https://github.com/vsouza/awesome-ios), [awesome-swift](https://github.com/matteocrippa/awesome-swift), [awesome](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome).

2. It's funny.
